    "Spatial resolution refers to the real-world representation of each pixel. This ranges widely, with the private satellite company Maxar announcing 15cm [resolution](https://blog.maxar.com/earth-intelligence/2020/introducing-15-cm-hd-the-highest-clarity-from-commercial-satellite-imagery), Sentinel at 10m, Landsat at 30m, and MODIS at 500. There are also large global products that have spatial resolution in the kilometers. The key point in dealing with spatial resolution is ensuring that your analysis drives your data collection, as there are tradeoffs involved. Using high resolution imagery can be expensive, both monetarily and computationally, if conducting continent wide analysis. Yet using low-resolution imagery will not be effective if your use case necessitates identifying individual buildings or small vehicles. Understanding the appropriate spatial resolution needed for your analysis is essential, and is why there are different platforms that focus on different spatial resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, spatial resolution depends on the projection of the sensor's instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of the ground and how a set of radiometric measurements are resampled into a regular grid. To see the difference in spatial resolution resulting from different sensors, let's visualize data from the three primary platforms."

    "## Temporal Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal resolution refers to the *revisit time*, or how often the same satellite platform covers the same place on earth. Historically, satellites have been large, solitary objects that had to make tradeoffs between spatial and temporal resolution - MODIS measures wide swathes of land with each sweep, and has relatively high temporal resolution. Landsat has improved spatial resolution but a revisit rate of 16 days, and NAIP is aggregated either annually or bi-annually. Over the past decade, satellite technology has improved and there is more diversity in mission sets. Cube satellites are small, shoe-box sized satellites that can provide both high-resolution imagery and, when mosaiced together, provide high temporal resolution as well. The tradeoff is that these satellites do not have the same array of sophisticated sensors that larger satellites are equipped with. Other satellites, such as those run by the intelligence community and private satellite companies, are designed for rapid revisit times of certain cities or political areas while not scanning the rest of the world. \n",

    "## Spectral Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral resolution refers to the number and width of spectral bands in which the sensor takes measurements. You can think of the width of spectral bands as the wavelength interval on the electromagnetic spectrum for each band. A sensor that measures radiance in multiple bands (e.g., collects a value for red, green, blue and near infrared) is called a *multispectral* sensor (generally 3-10 bands), while a sensor with many bands (possibly hundreds) is called a *hyperspectral* sensor (these are not hard and fast definitions). For example, compare the [multi-spectral OLI](http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=5779) aboard Landsat 8 to [Hyperion](https://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors/hyperioncoverage), a hyperspectral sensor that collects 220 unique spectral channels aboard the EO-1 satellite.\n",

    "\n",
    "Radiometric resolution refers to the value, or 'digital number' that the sensor records: _coarse_ radiometric resolution would record a scene with only a narrow range of values, whereas _fine_ radiometric resolution would record the same scene using a wide range of values. The _precision_ of the sensing, or the level of _quantization_ is another way to refer to radiometric resolution. 8 bit values (0-255) is the standard in many image processing tools. \n",

    "It might be possible to dig around in the metadata to find values for L<sub>min</sub> and L<sub>max</sub>, but computing radiometric resolution is generally not necessary unless you're studying phenomena that are distinguished by very subtle changes in radiance. One thing to keep in mind is that while sensors have developed and become more sensitive / accurate, capable of recording collecting data in upwards of 16 bits, that may not necessarily be beneficial for your work. Computation and storage costs grow, and normalizing the data to 8-bit values to work with tools such as OpenCV defeats the purpose of this sensitive colllection rate. There are use cases where high bit rate collection makes sense (e.g., looking for a very narrow range in a custom spectral range to identify mineral deposits), but ensure that you understand where and why higher radiometric resolution is necessary.

When you add an image to the map, Earth Engine handles the spatial display for you by recognizing the projection and putting all the pixels in the right place. However, you must specify how to stretch the DNs to fit the standard 8-bit display image  that GEE uses ( `min` and `max` parameters).
